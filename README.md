# CS240 Among Us

Data Structures projects in C (Phase A and B) for CS240 course of CSD - University of Crete. 

**Phase A** mostly uses **Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues** whereas **Phase B** focuses on **Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables and Priority Queues** (Heaps). Phase B is without any memory leaks, whereas Phase A has a couple, but nothing memory harmful (since heap memory is released after program exits). I am currently working on patching this up, valgrind is pretty useful in such cases. 

On each phase, we were simply given the preset Data Structures and we had to create the proper algorithms (from scratch) in order to use the data structures correctly. You need to read the projects' descriptions in order to use it, or use the given test files. Eitherway, they both focus on algorithmic time efficiency and proper data structures usage. 

Credits to our Professor Panagiota Fatourou ([course](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy240/current/en/index.php)) and her TAs for setting this up.
